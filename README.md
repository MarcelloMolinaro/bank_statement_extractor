# Bank Statement Extractor

A Python tool that extracts transactions from PDF bank statements and exports them to CSV format.

## Key Features

- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically chooses between text extraction and OCR
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple PDF files in a directory
- **🏷️ Categorization**: Categorizes transactions based on user-specified keywords
- **⚙️ Configurable**: YAML-based configuration for easy customization

**Text-based PDFs** (fast): Digital statements with selectable text
**Image-based PDFs** (slower): Scanned statements requiring OCR


## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MarcelloMolinaro/bank_statement_extractor.git
cd bank_statement_extractor

# 2. Setup (one time)
./scripts/build.sh

# 3. Add your PDFs to data/statements/

# 4. Run the extractor
./scripts/run.sh
```

That's it!

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config_example.yml` to customize behavior and rename to `config.yml`:

```yaml
# Directory paths
paths:
  pdf_path: "./data/statements/"
  output_dir: "data/output"

# Account information
account:
  account_name: "Your Bank"
  account_type: "Checking"

# Transaction categorization rules
categories:
  "INTEREST CREDIT": "Income/Interest Income"
  "PAYROLL": "Income/Salary"
  "TRANSFER": "Transfer"
  "VENMO": "Transfer"
  "AMAZON": "Shopping"
  "STARBUCKS": "Food & Dining"
  # Add your own rules...

# CSV output options
csv:
  headers: ["Date", "Account", "Description", "Check #", "Category", "Credit", "Debit", "Account Name"]
  ocr_headers: ["Date", "Category", "Description", "Debit Amount", "Credit Amount"]
  write_individual_files: false  # Set to true for per-statement CSVs
```

## Advanced Usage & Configuration

### Custom Categories
Add new categorization rules in `config.yml`:
```yaml
categories:
  "YOUR KEYWORD": "Your Category"
  "VENMO": "Transfer"
  "SCHWAB": "Investments"
  "UBER": "Transportation"
```

### OCR Coordinate Configuration
For different bank layouts, adjust OCR X-coordinates in `config.yml`:
```yaml
ocr:
  x_ranges:
    Date: [135, 296]      # X pixels for date column
    Description: [296, 1643]  # X pixels for description column
    Credit: [1643, 2052]  # X pixels for credit column
    Debit: [2052, 2470]   # X pixels for debit column
```

### PDF Date Formats
- The tool extracts the year from the filename, defaulting to current year when no
4 digit year is  found.
- The date formatting for dates within statements liekly doesn't capture all date formats
- Room for improvement here!

## Troubleshooting

### No transactions extracted
- Check if PDF contains "Transaction Detail" (for Text based) or "Activity Description" (for OCR) sections
- Verify PDF files are in the `data/statements/` directory
- For debugging, you can run the specific extraction methods manually:
  - `python src/extract_pdf_text.py` (for text-based PDFs)
  - `python src/extract_pdf_ocr.py` (for image-based PDFs)

### Missing transaction descriptions
- Check if continuation lines are being captured
- OCR currently skips page 2 (no data found there)
- OCR Coordinate configs might need adjustment

### OCR-specific issues
- **Slow processing**: OCR is inherently slower than text extraction
- **Missing data**: Check Y-coordinate filtering in the OCR script
- **Garbled text**: Try adjusting OCR DPI settings (currently 300)
- **Incorrect data**: See OCR  X-Coordinate Configuration above

### Configuration issues
- If you changed the csv_headers at all, you might need to re-map any new fields in the .py files

### System Dependencies
- `tesseract`: OCR engine (must be installed via conda during setup)
- ... this worked... but Brew should work as well
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tesseract-data-eng
```

## Future updates
- Dynamic OCR coordinate recognition (X and Y)
- Dynamic CSV Header generation based on transaction content
- Dynamic page skipping when transaction data is not present
- Better date parsing

## Privacy & Security

- **PDF files are ignored by git**: Your bank statements stay private
- **Local processing**: All data stays on your machine
- **No network calls**: Tool works completely offline
